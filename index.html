      <p><h2><b>ABOUT ME</b></h2></p>

       <p>Serendipitous enough, in my younger years I had a penchant for learning technology, and was very much a completionist for the video games I adored. Later as the schooltime years rolled futher, my creativity becaome far more bold and the illustrative and digital arts became my sole focus. Many years and many adventures later in Texas, one of my dearest friends helped me realized it was in Tech I belong and can fully flourish.</p>
        
        <p>I am naturally social and collaborative, I can communicate and boost moral in any team!</p>
         <p>My unique background in education, career paths, and adventures equip me with hard-to-find skillsets and approach to creating products that are stylistic, functional, and above par in any way I can achieve.</p>
         <p><ol class="bullet">My background and interests include but not limited to:</p>
         <li>Illustration Studies</li>
         <li>Photography</li>
         <li>HealthCare and Emergency Response</li>
         <li>Natural Wellness</li>
         <li>Travel and Mobility</li>
         <li>Motorcycles and Food</li>
         <li>Automation and Machine Learning</li></ol></p>
       <br>
      <p>I am currently a student with Thinkful in their Software Engineering Program. I look forward into diving right into the development field; I have the confidence to not only become a valuable asset to your team but also smoothly adapt to your company culture. </p>
